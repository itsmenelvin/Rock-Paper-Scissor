# Rock-Paper-Scissor

## Site: [Demo](https://itsmenelvin.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissor/)

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where each player simultaneously chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same option, the game is a tie. The game is often used as a method of making a quick, random decision.
